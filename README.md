stones - simple game in Scala

# ideas

* move neighbours method from board to pieces.
- it helps to code readability
* same with makeMove method. Move it from logic to player.
- code will be more natural, but might be more complicated.
* board toList method should be replaced by getPieces.
* consider changing the way in which board is drawn.
- now view know coordinates of the board, 
- but maybe it has to be that way and now it is clean and readable.
* consider change generic board array from type any to generic type
* replace type pattern matching with constructor matching
